twist functions
write a history "player 1, player 2"-array of what moves have been made so far


GAME RULES
what happens when both players connect 4 after a twist?

UI

KI
functions that help the AI
getGameState >> return matrix
getLastMove >>	return column (0-6) or turn left or turn right
rate game state >> return a number between 1(player 1 wins 100%) and 2(player 2 wins 100%)
heuristic used to evaluate a game state is:
count of ia's four-in-row * 1000 + count of ia's three-in-row * 100 + count of ia's two-in-row * 10 - count of human's three-in-row * 100 - count of human's two-in-row * 10 + current depth of tree.
python formula: (ia_fours * 100000 + ia_threes * 100 + ia_twos * 10) - (human_threes * 100 + human_twos * 10) + depth
